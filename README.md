A simplified version of [tingletech's moon-phase repo](https://github.com/tingletech/moon-phase), this code aims to draw a phase-accurate SVG moon. Improvements were made to the CSS styling, scaling, and centering of the DOM elements, and those bits I hope to soon extract and PR back to [moon-phase](https://github.com/tingletech/moon-phase).

Originally built to generate the `background-image` for a client's site, but the client didnâ€™t love it, so now here it is.
